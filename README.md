# ProsperityMobile
***PROSPERITYMOBILE IS NOT FINISHED AND NOT READY TO USE YET.***  

ProsperityMobile is supposed to be the realization of open source native cross platform client for UPH University.  
I must stress beforehand that the use of UPH's API is NOT officially supported by UPH. Please do not ask UPH for any form of support regarding this application. But rather, create a new issue if you find any problem or suggestion.

## What's new ?  
UPH recently released its UPH Mobile application on Google Play Store bringing a mobile specific easy-to-use API for the application to take advantage from. However, there are reasons to pick an alternative as the clean API is easily accessible by anyone. Some of them are because of bulky application, slow to load, distracting unwanted contents, bad application flow, unknown privacy and security practices, and more.  

Therefore, here we are (while we are not complete). Prosperity is not a new project though. I had made a somewhat brokenâ€” yet sometimes working data scraper to be used as a middleware between Prosperity web and UPH Peoplesoft site and a Prosperity web client itself. Both of them were a prototype as the real application should be a native mobile or and desktop application. Being able to get access to the proper API means anyone can easily hook it to their application as they like.  

The only thing to wait now is the making of the mobile client which was planned to be React Native based iOS and Android applications. I wish I would not be lazy or too busy and actually finishes the app for not too long.  

### About SSO Login  
It really sucks that Microsoft Office 365 SSO web interface is hard to bypass. Really, just letting the user logged in forever and forget is the most headache-free road to pick. It signs the user in and gives the access token back which can be used to fetch any data for weekly schedule, grade, finance, and other basic student pack you would expect. I apologize that I can not do much for this.  

### Will ProsperityMobile spy on me ?  
No. The binaries that will be released are compiled from the source that is freely available for anyone to look at here at Github. If you have any problem, suggestion, or any feedback, you can create a new Github issue.
